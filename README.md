# Pitch Skills

A collection of structured skills focused on pitching, fundraising, and investor readiness.

Built for founders who want to systematize how they communicate, from early-stage positioning to investor Q&A.

This repository breaks pitching into discrete, trainable components.

## What are Skills?

Skills are structured markdown modules that isolate one specific capability inside pitching and fundraising.

Each skill includes:

- Summary  
- What This Skill Really Is  
- Why It Matters  
- Core Components  
- Framework / Method  
- Examples (Bad vs Better)  
- Failure Modes  
- Practice Drills  
- What Mastery Looks Like  
- Related Skills  

The goal is clarity and repeatability.
