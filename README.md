# Pitch Skills

> The open-source operating system for investor-ready founders.

Pitch Skills is a structured skill library for builders who pitch in the arena.

Not theory.  
Not MBA slides.  
Not motivational noise.  

This is tactical, operator-grade pitching.

## Why This Exists

Most founders don’t fail because of bad ideas.

They fail because they:

- can’t compress their message
- leak doubt through language
- present information without tension
- show numbers without signaling credibility
- lose control in Q&A

Pitch Skills turns pitching into a trainable system.

# 🧠 Skill Architecture

Every skill follows the same structure:

- Summary  
- What This Skill Really Is  
- Why It Matters  
- Core Components  
- Framework / Method  
- Examples (Bad vs Better)  
- Failure Modes  
- Practice Drills  
- What Mastery Looks Like  

This is deliberate.

Clarity > volume.
