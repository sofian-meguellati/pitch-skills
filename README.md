# Pitch Skills

A structured skill library for founders who want to become investor-ready.

Pitch Skills breaks pitching into discrete, trainable components.
Each skill is designed to be practical, specific, and applied.

---

## Philosophy

Pitching is not talent.

It is a system composed of:

- clarity
- structure
- positioning
- signaling
- controlled delivery

Each skill in this repository isolates one of these components.

---

## Skill Format

Every skill follows the same structure:

- Summary
- What This Skill Really Is
- Why It Matters
- Core Components
- Framework / Method
- Examples (Bad vs Better)
- Failure Modes
- Practice Drills
- What Mastery Looks Like
- Related Skills

Consistency is intentional.
