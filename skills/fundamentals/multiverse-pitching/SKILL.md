# Multiverse Pitching

## Summary

Multiverse Pitching is having multiple versions of your pitch ready:
- 5 seconds
- 30 seconds
- 2 minutes
- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes

Same core truth.
Different depth.

Operators don’t “wing it” depending on time.
They deploy the right version instantly.

---

## What This Skill Really Is

Not memorizing scripts.

It’s building a modular pitch where:
- the core stays stable
- details expand when time allows

If each version sounds like a different company, you’re not coherent yet.

---

## Why It Matters

Real life is chaotic:

- elevator moment (5s)
- networking (30s)
- demo day (2m)
- VC intro (5m)
- partner meeting (10m)

If you only have one pitch length, you’ll either:
- rush and sound messy
- ramble and lose attention

---

## Core Components

### 1) Stable core
One line identity: problem + solution + who.

### 2) Expand in layers
Add layers in this order:
- stakes
- differentiation
- proof
- ask

### 3) Time control
You must be able to stop mid-flow without collapsing coherence.

---

## The Expansion Ladder

### 5 seconds: identity hit
> “We help [who] solve [pain] by [how].”

### 30 seconds: pain + turning point + proof
Problem → consequence → solution → proof.

### 2 minutes: add differentiation + traction
Add “why you win” + 2–3 traction signals.

### 5 minutes: add market + business model
Scale story + how money works.

### 10 minutes: add GTM + risks + roadmap
More depth + credible plan.

## Examples (Bad vs Better)

**Bad (30s)**
> “We’re building a platform leveraging AI to disrupt…”

**Better (30s)**
> “Procurement teams lose weeks on vendor risk checks.  
> That delays rollout and increases compliance exposure.  
> We centralize risk review into one workflow and cut evaluation time by 60%.  
> Two paid pilots are live right now.”

---

## Failure Modes

- different versions tell different stories
- 30-second pitch becomes feature list
- you can’t stop (ramble) when interrupted
- you frontload details (lose attention)
- you don’t have proof in short versions

---

## Practice Drills

### 1) Timer reps
Practice each version with a timer.
Hit the stop cleanly.

### 2) Interruption drill
Have a friend interrupt at random.
You must end cleanly in one sentence.

### 3) Core sentence audit
If your 5-second line isn’t sharp, fix it first.
Everything depends on it.

## What Mastery Looks Like

- you can pitch anywhere, instantly
- you stay clear at any time limit
- people ask for the longer version (that’s the goal)
- your story stays consistent across contexts
