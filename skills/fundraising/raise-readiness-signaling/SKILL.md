# Raise Readiness Signaling

## Summary

Raise Readiness Signaling is making your pitch feel “fundable” even before deep diligence.

It’s the difference between:
- “interesting idea”
and
- “this team is ready to deploy capital.”

---

## What This Skill Really Is

It’s not a bigger deck.
It’s not more hype.

It’s showing the room you have:
- a clear model
- a credible plan
- awareness of risks
- proof you can execute

Readiness is a signal.
You can design for it.

---

## Why It Matters

Investors are pattern-matching.

They ask:
- Is this real demand?
- Can this team ship and sell?
- Is there a scaling path?
- Do they know their risks?
- Will capital accelerate outcomes?

If your pitch doesn’t answer these, the answer becomes “not yet.”

---

## Core Components

### 1) Execution proof
Traction with context (not vanity).

### 2) Model clarity
How you make money, who pays, why it scales.

### 3) GTM realism
A believable go-to-market path (not “we’ll go viral”).

### 4) Risk awareness
Name the real risks and how you mitigate them.

### 5) Capital logic
Raise amount + use of funds tied to milestones.

---

## The Readiness Checklist (Operator Version)

Your pitch should make these statements obvious:

- “They know exactly who they sell to.”
- “They have evidence the user sticks/pays.”
- “They can explain the unit economics.”
- “They know what could kill them.”
- “This raise buys a specific milestone.”

---

## Examples (Bad vs Better)

**Bad**
> “We’re raising $2M to grow.”

**Better**
> “We’re raising $2M to hit 3 milestones:  
> 1) expand from 2 to 12 paid pilots,  
> 2) reach $25k MRR with retention above X,  
> 3) ship enterprise readiness (SSO + audit logs).”

**Bad**
> “Our market is huge.”

**Better**
> “We win first in [wedge], then expand to [adjacent]. The expansion trigger is [proof].”

---

## Failure Modes

- vague use of funds
- no milestones tied to capital
- hiding risks (investors smell it)
- big projections with no mechanism
- confusing business model

---

## Practice Drills

### 1) Milestone mapping
Write:
> “This raise buys ____ by ____ date.”
Make it measurable.

### 2) Risk paragraph
Write 3 real risks.
Write 1 mitigation per risk.
Keep it calm and factual.

### 3) Capital story
Explain your raise in 20 seconds:
amount → why → milestones → outcome.

---

## What Mastery Looks Like

- investors move faster to next steps
- questions shift from “what is this?” to “how big can it get?”
- you sound prepared for diligence
- your raise feels like acceleration, not survival
