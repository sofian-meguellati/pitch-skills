# Stakeholder Mapping

## Summary

Stakeholder Mapping is identifying:
- who cares
- who decides
- who blocks
- who influences

…then pitching each with the proof they need.

A pitch isn’t “one message.”
It’s a controlled message per stakeholder.

---

## What This Skill Really Is

In real life, deals die because of someone who wasn’t in the room.

Enterprise and fundraising both have invisible stakeholders:
- risk
- compliance
- IT
- procurement
- internal champions
- skeptical operators

If you pitch only to the “main listener,” you lose later.

---

## Why It Matters

Great pitches don’t just persuade.
They prevent rejection later.

Stakeholder mapping turns your pitch into an internal memo your champion can forward.

---

## Core Components

### 1) Identify the cast
Common roles:
- Economic buyer (budget owner)
- User (daily pain)
- IT / security (risk)
- Procurement (process)
- Champion (internal seller)
- Skeptic (political blocker)

### 2) Predict their “no”
Every stakeholder has a default objection.

### 3) Match proof to objection
You don’t answer with words.
You answer with evidence.

## The Operator Method

### Step 1: Write the org map
List stakeholders you need for “yes.”

### Step 2: For each, write:
- their incentive
- their fear
- what proof they need

### Step 3: Build “proof blocks” in your deck/appendix
Examples:
- security slide (IT)
- ROI calculator (buyer)
- implementation timeline (ops)
- procurement readiness (procurement)
- user testimonials (users)

## Examples (Bad vs Better)

**Bad**
> “We save time.”

**Better (CFO)**
> “We reduce processing costs by 40% and pay back in 60 days.”

**Better (IT)**
> “We integrate via X, SSO supported, audit logs included.”

**Better (Users)**
> “One-click workflow replaces 12-step manual process.”

## Failure Modes

- pitching “one-size-fits-all”
- ignoring blockers (IT/procurement)
- no champion package (they can’t sell internally)
- claiming ROI with no math
- hiding implementation effort

---

## Practice Drills

### 1) Stakeholder sheet
Create a one-pager:
role → incentive → fear → proof.

### 2) Champion-forward test
Can your champion forward one slide internally to win the next meeting?

### 3) Objection prediction
Write the top 3 objections per stakeholder.
Build an appendix slide for each.
