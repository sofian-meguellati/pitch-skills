# Competitive Positioning Clarity

## Summary

Competitive Positioning Clarity is defining:
- what category you’re in
- what you replace
- why you win
- what trade-off you accept

…without trash-talking competitors.

Operators don’t say “we’re better.”
They show the strategic wedge.

---

## What This Skill Really Is

Positioning is not a competitor table.

It’s a decision frame:
> “Given this pain and these constraints, our approach is the right one.”

Great positioning makes your strategy feel intentional.

---

## Why It Matters

If you can’t position cleanly, investors assume:
- you don’t know the landscape
- you’re a feature, not a company
- incumbents will crush you

Positioning is how you earn the right to exist.

---

## Core Components

### 1) Category clarity
Name the real category in plain language.

### 2) Replacement target
What do people do today instead of you? (Often it’s spreadsheets, manual work, hacks.)

### 3) Wedge
The narrow entry point you dominate first.

### 4) Trade-off honesty
What you’re *not* optimizing for (yet). This signals maturity.

---

## The Operator Positioning Frame

Use 4 lines:

1) **Today:** “Most teams do X.”  
2) **Failure:** “This fails because Y.”  
3) **Our wedge:** “We win by Z.”  
4) **Trade-off:** “We prioritize A over B (for now).”  

---

## Examples (Bad vs Better)

**Bad**
> “Competitors are outdated, we’re modern.”

**Better**
> “Teams manage vendor risk in spreadsheets.  
> That fails because reviews are inconsistent and audit trails break.  
> We win by standardizing review into one workflow with built-in audit logs.  
> We prioritize compliance and speed over deep customization at first.”

---

## Failure Modes

- “we have no competitors” (instant red flag)
- attacking incumbents emotionally
- feature comparison instead of strategy comparison
- too broad (“we do everything”)
- no wedge (no reason you win early)

---

## Practice Drills

### 1) The spreadsheet test
Write what people do without you.
If you can’t name it, you don’t know your replacement target.

### 2) Wedge sentence
Finish:
> “We win first in ____ because ____.”

### 3) Trade-off statement
Write one honest limitation that is strategic, not weakness:
> “We’re not optimizing for ___ yet, because ___.”
