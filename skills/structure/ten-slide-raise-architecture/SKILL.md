# The 10-Slide Raise Architecture

## Summary

This skill is building a pitch deck that matches how investors actually listen:

Tension → Solution → Proof → Scale → Ask

Most decks fail because they are *unordered truth*.
This is how you order it.

---

## What This Skill Really Is

Not “make slides.”

It’s managing attention and belief across a fixed time window.
Every slide must answer a question the room already has.

If you jump ahead, you lose them.
If you lag, you bore them.

---

## Why It Matters

A deck is not information.
It’s a guided decision.

A clean structure:
- reduces confusion
- increases perceived competence
- makes Q&A easier
- makes the ask feel earned

---

## Core Components

### 1) One slide = one job
No mixed messages.

### 2) Tension before scale
Don’t talk market size before pain and consequence.

### 3) Proof before dreams
Traction and execution signals before big projections.

### 4) Earn the ask
The raise amount and use of funds must feel inevitable.

## The 10 Slides (Operator Version)

1) **Title / Identity**
Who you are + one-line mission (no fluff).

2) **Problem**
Specific, painful, urgent.

3) **Consequence**
What it costs (time/money/risk). Raise stakes.

4) **Current alternatives**
Why status quo fails (no competitor hate).

5) **Solution**
What you do, simply.

6) **Why you win**
Differentiation / positioning. One clear edge.

7) **Traction**
3 metrics max. Context + meaning.

8) **Market / Expansion**
Where this scales. Why now.

9) **Business model**
How money is made (simple).

10) **Team + Ask**
Why this team, and what you’re raising + use of funds.

Optional appendix: objections, details, proof.

## Examples (Bad vs Better)

**Bad**
> Slide 2: Market size  
> Slide 3: Product UI

**Better**
> Slide 2: Pain  
> Slide 3: Stakes  
> Slide 4: Why existing tools don’t fix it  
> Then: solution

---

## Failure Modes

- starting with TAM (instant “so what?”)
- showing features before urgency
- mixing positioning + traction on one slide
- putting the ask too early
- having no appendix for Q&A

---

## Practice Drills

### 1) The “slide job” rewrite
Write one sentence per slide: “This slide’s job is ____.”
If you can’t, you’re mixing.

### 2) The 2-minute run
Present the deck in 2 minutes.
If you can’t keep it coherent, structure is off.

### 3) The “earned ask” check
Ask yourself:
> “Would I invest by slide 9?”
If not, your proof comes too late.

## What Mastery Looks Like

- people stay oriented the whole time
- your solution lands after pressure is built
- your ask feels like the next logical step
- Q&A is cleaner because you already answered the big questions
